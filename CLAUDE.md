# Forge — Project Guidelines for Claude

## Versioning

**Bump `forge/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version for every material change.**

A change is material if it can affect the engineering workflow of a user who has
already installed Forge. This includes:

- Bug fixes to any command, hook, tool spec, or workflow
- Changes to tool specs (`forge/meta/tool-specs/`) that alter generated tool behaviour
- Changes to command files (`forge/commands/`) that alter how commands behave
- Changes to hooks (`forge/hooks/`)
- New commands or tools
- Schema changes to `.forge/store/` or `.forge/config.json`

**Also required with every version bump:**

1. Add a migration entry to `forge/migrations.json` with:
   - `"from"` key = previous version
   - `"version"` = new version
   - `"notes"` = one-line human-readable summary
   - `"regenerate"` = list of targets users must regenerate (`"tools"`, `"workflows"`, etc.), or `[]` if none
   - `"breaking"` = `true` if manual steps are needed before regenerating
   - `"manual"` = list of manual step descriptions (empty array if none)

2. If `"tools"` or `"workflows"` is in `regenerate`, users will need to run
   `/forge:update` after installing — make sure the migration notes are clear.

**What does NOT need a version bump:** documentation-only changes, typo fixes
in `docs/`, README updates, or changes that have no effect on installed projects.

## Plugin Structure

- `forge/` — the installable plugin (this is what users get via `/plugin install`)
- `forge/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — canonical version source
- `forge/migrations.json` — migration chain read by `/forge:update`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — marketplace descriptor (repo root)
- `forge/hooks/check-update.js` and `.sh` — session-start update detector;
  remote URL must point to `forge/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` on `main`
