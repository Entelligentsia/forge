# Update Plan
## Algorithm

```
1. Load Context:
   - Read the original task prompt
   - Read the current PLAN.md
   - Read the review artifact (PLAN_REVIEW.md)

2. Analysis:
   - Review the numbered, actionable items in the review artifact
   - Determine where the plan was insufficient or incorrect

3. Revision:
   - Update PLAN.md to address all review findings
   - Ensure the revised plan remains aligned with the task prompt
   - Update the "Operational Impact" or "Testing Strategy" if the revision changed them

4. Finalize:
   - Update task status via `/forge:store update-status task {taskId} status planned`
   - Emit the complete event via `/forge:store emit {sprintId} '{event-json}'`
   - Execute Token Reporting (see `_fragments/finalize.md`)
