# 🗻 Meta-Workflow: Approve Task

## Purpose

The Architect gives final sign-off on a completed task after Supervisor approval. This is the last gate before commit.

## Algorithm

```
1. Load Context:
   - Read task prompt
   - Read final PLAN.md
   - Read approved CODE_REVIEW.md
   - Read PROGRESS.md

2. Architectural Review:
   - Verify implementation aligns with project architecture
   - Check for cross-cutting concerns (impact on other modules)
   - Assess operational impact (deployment changes, migrations)

3. Sign Off:
   - Write ARCHITECT_APPROVAL.md with:
     - Approval status
     - Deployment notes
     - Follow-up items for future sprints

4. Finalize:
   - Update task status via `/forge:store update-status task {taskId} status approved`
   - Emit the complete event via `/forge:store emit {sprintId} '{event-json}'`
   - Execute Token Reporting (see Generation Instructions)
```

## Generation Instructions

- **Workflow Structure:** The generated `approve_task.md` must follow the strict "Algorithm" block format.
- **Context Isolation:** Forbid inline execution of complex architectural analysis; use the `Agent` tool for sub-tasks.
- **Project Specifics:**
  - Reference project's architecture docs.
  - Include project-specific deployment concerns.
- **Token Reporting:** The generated workflow MUST mandate the following before returning:
  1. Run `/cost` to retrieve session token usage.
  2. Parse: `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`, `cacheWriteTokens`, `estimatedCostUSD`.
  3. Write the usage sidecar via `/forge:store emit {sprintId} '{sidecar-json}' --sidecar`.
- **Event Emission:** Ensure the "complete" event includes the `eventId` passed by the orchestrator.
